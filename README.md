## Styling

### Font

The fonts used for this site are Orbitron for the logo, the main menu and h1/h2 tags. Montserrat was used for the p tags with. Both these font's have a backup of "Sans-Serif":

- I chose [Orbitron](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orbitron?query=Orbitron+) for it's modern bold design. The letters are very readable. This font-family is used for h1 and h2 tags
- For the p tags I chose [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=Montserrat) for it fits well with "Orbitron". It's also very clearly visiable and modern.

### Icons

- All icons are made by the developer

### Color Scheme

For this game I used 4 different colors:

- Green
- Yellow
- Dark blue
- Red

This colours were chosen because of the type of game it is. I also tried to implement all colors across the page where that was possible for consistency

<img src="https://github.com/NikolaVk/don-t-get-angry/blob/main/assets/readme/colour-scheme.PNG" width="100%">

I also tested these colours with [Contrast Checker](https://contrastchecker.com/) where a user needs to click or read something

- White on red

This passes on all tests accept if font is lower tha 18px. However all buttons contain font over 18 pixels, they are all bold and the user gets a hover effect.

This again passes all tests accept one. This time it's a colour blindness test (score must be 500 or above). This is only used on a font size 26px and all letters are bold. Also the user doesn't need to interact with these elements. They only indicate player 1 to 4.
